##Developing data product project

I adapted the [Shiny word cloud App](http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/word-cloud.html) for my own books. It creates word cloud based on the words found in the book chosen.

**How to use the application:**

1. Choose your favorite book
2. Change book and a word cloud appears
3. Use slider *Minimum Frequency of Words* and *Maximum Number of Words* to change the appearance of the word cloud

***Note:** There is a bug with the slider "Minimum Frequency of Words" which I need to fix*
